## Description
Consider the set of all reduced fractions between `0` and `1` inclusive with denominators less than or equal to `n`.

Here is the set when `n = 5`:

```
0/1 1/5 1/4 1/3 2/5 1/2 3/5 2/3 3/4 4/5 1/1
```

Write a program that, given an integer `n` between `1` and `160` inclusive, prints the fractions in order of increasing magnitude.

## Input
A single integer `n`.

## Output
Fractions sorted in order of magnitude.

## Samples

```

### Sample Output 1
```
0/1 1/5 1/4 1/3 2/5 1/2 3/5 2/3 3/4 4/5 1/1
